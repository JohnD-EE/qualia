The new way of connecting post-2020

Qualia is that ineffible human experience that can't be described in words, or accounted for by science - it's the eperience of an awe inspiring sunset, the enchantment of listening to a concert pianist, the ecstacy of dance, the exquisite taste of wine, the rapturous appreciation of the cosmos, the the wonder of falling in love, or the smell of a log fire on christmas morning...

2020 has been a pivotal year. Everything has changed and will never go back to the way it was. Work has changed, meeting friends has changed, hospitality has changed - forever. 

But maybe we were heading for change anyway, a great turning, and Covid was just the catylist. One consequence of humanities relentless industrial and technological advances has been that we've lost the essence of what binds us together to give our lives meaning. We've become disconnected from nature, disconnected from each other and communities, disconnected from our work, and disconnected from our selves. Isolation, lonelines, alienation, despair and depression were already a symptom of modern life as we were all racing along in our servitude to the economic treadmill.

As many of our old ways of living and working are no longer viable, we'll see many businesses fail, as our fundamental models of living and work need a rethink.

#### Beyond 2020:
What if there's a better way of living and working, a better way of meeting our fundamental human needs of connection, belonging, and tasting all of life's expansive and playful possibilities.

### Qualia is...
* Qualia is the human experience of connection.
* Qualia combines physical and online spaces to connect with others, creating the conditions which are best suited for the type of connection.
* Qualia is also a philosophy for interbeing - providing curated experiences in the best possible setting for convivial and purposful social connections.

### QualiaPods:
QualiaPods are modular spaces for connecting people in convivial settings.  Imagine a space, such as an industrial unit, a repurposed office or a repurposed high street department store which is fillied with uniqueliy decorated, air-contidioned, sound-proofed pods, furnished in the way you want for the purposes of whatever gathering you're having.

During the daytime, the Qualia Pods will be mostly used for business meetings, comfy chairs, monitors, whiteboards and coffees.  A functional space to get things done and if you want QualiaCurator to facilitate or mediate a meeting, then a remote or onsite curator can be arranged to ensure the optimal experience for all...

During the evenings and into the early hours of the morning the QualiaPods can be re-formatted for social events.

#### QualiaPod uses:
* Perhaps you'd like to equip a QualiaPod with a turntable, to have a get-together with friends listening to vynils.
* Or a QualiaPod set up with a couch or cinema seats to watch a movie together.
* How about a QualiaPod set up as a Poker or roullette table? Or remotely curated whisky tasting event againsts views of the Scottish Highlands and folk music. Perhap you're a musician and want a relaxed Qualia Pod, already set up with an electronic drum kit, guitars and effects peddles, ready to jam with?
* A QualiaPod may be customised for just two people having a quiet evning together or a group of 10 relaxing in a chill-out zone after the night club closes.
* Perhaps you're a YouTuber and want to use a QualiaPod to record your shows, set up with mics, recording equipment, green screens or custom backgrounds.
* There could even be pop-up QualiaPods, as shipping containers or yurts with camp-fires during the summer, all adhearing to the aim of giving the optimal Qualia Experience.

The QualiaPod experience would be accompanied by a website and app, allowing you to book and customise your experience online, choosing from a range of default configurations and curated experiences, or creating your own from a pick-and-mix selection.

Nothing will be the same again after 2020, this is our opportunity to create new, and better ways of coming together as human beings...
